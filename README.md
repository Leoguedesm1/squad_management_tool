# Sobre o Projeto

Para auxiliar na interface foi utilizada a lib [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/pt/) e a lib [React-tag-input](https://betterstack.dev/projects/react-tag-input/).\
Foram utilizados tanto quanto styled components, quanto sobrescrita das classes dos componentes da material ui.\
Também foi utilizada ContextAPI. A ideia era usar dois contextos diferentes, Teams: para salvar todos os dados de todos os times, e Team: para facilitar na edição de um time.

## Tarefas Completas

Interface da home está completa apesar de uma parte estar mockada.\
Lista de Squads está com ContextAPI.\
Botão de excluir da lista.\
Botão de ordenar da lista.\
Página de Novo Time só possui a primeira parte do formulário.\
É possível salvar Novos Times.

## Detalhes

Atualmente estou empregado e fazendo hora extra, o que fiz foi no final de semana, não rolou tudo.\
Tentei seguir o método do git-flow, mas no final estava correndo um pouco e fiz um commit enorme.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
